# Milestone 11

## Team Member Contributions

Alex - Leaderboard design and virus design

John - Sign in, sign up, and leaderboard backend and frontend functionality.  You can now sign in on the main page and you
will remain signed in until you sign out.  Sign up takes an email and password and will do more as we finalize the account
information.  The leaderboard calls gets the top 10 players.

Sophia - Choose virus page matches the theme of epidemic go, changed landing page, switched virus page to have a touch activated carousel of the different virus options where the user can choose a virus and have it updated. Once choosen a modal now pops up to confirm before moving the user to the homepage. Resized images for page through Illustrator.

Xu - Account page and main page redesigns

## UI Improvements

The main screen has a better layout and allows for signing in.  The leaderboard is still undergoing some changes, but it
now shows the top players.  The choose virus page has a better UI and allows you to see the details of each potential virus.
