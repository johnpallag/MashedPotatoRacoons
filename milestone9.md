# Milestone 9

## Team Member Contributions
Alex - Virus design and UI design for whole page.

John - View core functionality.  Multiple player visualization.  Tracking multiple players on the server.  
Better navigation saving.  Showing viruses on map.  Infect button working.  Point system for nearby.  Show who you're infected by.

Sophia - Updated choose virus page. "Your virus" is the top image and clicking on a virus changes your image or clicking choose in the
virus modal. Change name of modal to stats. Added new navigation bar. Played with a few new layouts but stuck with 3 viruses per row.
Page: https://epidemic-go.herokuapp.com/choose_virus/index.html *** put in inspection mode to view it properly (otherwise looks wonky)
         
Xu - Update profile page and css file



## Core Functionality:
The map now shows the virus of each person logged in.  It shows a radius of their effect.  
You can see a heatmap of your past location.  The infect button determines who is near you and infects them
with some probability.  The list at the bottom shows who has infected you in real time.  Infections are carried as well.
