# Milestone 14
## Alex
Powerup icons and how to play.
## John
Added powerups which temporarily increase infection radius.  Added several stats (like distance and number of powerups).  Added infection timer so viruses don't infect you forever.  Added logout button to account page.  Added ability to update your virus.
## Sophia
Changed distances for viruses so the distances are more realistic. Changed howToPlay so that it fits the style of the rest of the application. Changed Profile/Achievments style. Added logout button to navigation bars on all of the pages. Fixed small wording errors.
Made change virus button work (John made it actually update).
## Xu
Profile picture on account page and menus.  Account page updates.

## Description
We finished the UI for Epidemic Go!  You can now update your virus as you play by going to the account page and pressing change.  The game now keeps track of the number of powerups you've gotten and how far you've walked while playing the game.  Powerups are now randomly dropped around players which temporarily increase the infection radius.  Infections now last for a temporary amount of time.
