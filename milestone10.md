# Milestone 10

Our app, Epidemic Go!, combines competition and exploration in a virus-themed game. Each player has a virus.  The goal 
is to infect as many other players as possible while moving about the world. Infected players carry the virus for a period
of time, spreading all the viruses to those they infect.
A primary goal of our game is to encourage young adults to leave their basements (not that Californians have them).
With the massive success of games like Pokemon Go!, we feel that this app is a great addition to the mix.
Epidemic Go! adds the concept of "infection" which causes other players to spread viruses and gain points.
Virus simulator games tend to be computer-based, confining the player to a chair, whereas ours is based on physical location.
The playful nature of Epidemic Go! makes it suitable for all ages.  It encourages friendly competition and 
prompts all players to get "out-and-about."
