# Proposal
---
## Title
Epidemic Go

## Idea
A virus simulator that takes your past and current location data, along with other parameters, and predicts how long it would take for you to infect the world!  Compete with friends to see who can infect more.

## Storyboard

## Feedback
* By Team A4: what is the relavence of a simple virus simulator?  Why would people keep coming back? - We want to make it multi-player and contingent on your movement
* By Team 0xDEADBEEF: what is the drive of the drawing app?  Share with other people? - We want to allow other players to infect each other the more they get close to others
* By Team 0xDEADBEEF: missing point of virus simulator - More of a game that you keep coming back to play
* By Team Guodaddy: missing point of "real" viruses - More of a custom virus idea
* By Alok: I start off with a virus and I can spread it out to someone and they can spread their virus and yours too.

## Features
* Tracks your movements
* Create look of virus
* View effect on map

* Point system for time to infect world?
* Multiplayer aspect - infected players carry other viruses

## Splitting up the work

* John: Simulator & client side of network
* Sophia: Mapping / tracking position & help on simulator
* Xu: UI & client interaction
