John - Heat map (view core functionality).  Multiple player visualization.  Tracking multiple players on the server.  Better navigation saving.

Sophia - Worked on the choose virus page, switched from boostrap to materialize, created viruses with Illustrator
         and made it so that clicking on the images of the virsus also opens their individiual modals. 
         Page: https://epidemic-go.herokuapp.com/choose_virus/index_notbootstrap.html
         
Xu - Worked on Main page and How to play page, added profile and levels showing up in the sidenav and a new page to how to play.

## Core Functionality:
The map now has heat maps of each person that has longed on. Each person getting a different color.
The map als covers a smaller area when you open it (more zoomed in).
